## Disclaimer

> This is buggy and unfinished, use at your own risk!

This project is a fork from [Hana][]'s build system, so all of the credit goes
to [Louis Dione][] for the great work he is doing. It also steals some ideas
from the build systems of [Paul Fultz II][] [FIT][]'s library and
[Eric Niebler][]'s [range-v3][] library. It is released under the Boost Software
license, but note that some of the libraries that are optionally provided might
have a different license.

## Overview

Setting up a modern C++ project with Continuous Integration is a time-consuming
task. The amount of tools available is daunting, and one really wants to use
them all: [CMake][], [gh-pages][] and [Doxygen][] for documentation,
[Travis-CI][] for continuous integration, [Coveralls][] for displaying code
coverage reports, [clang-format][] for auto-formatting, [valgrind][],
[sanitizers][], [swang][], [static-analyzer][], and many more!

The aim of this project is to give you a fully-functional starting point for
your own projects, so that you can skip setting up most of these tools
correctly. Every project is different tho, so we expect you to modify your build
system over time. This skeleton is just there to give you the fundamentals,
anything else is up to you! Send a PR if you find something is missing.

## What you get

- [CMake][] as a meta-build system:
  - debug/release builds,
  - high-optimization for release builds,
  - extensive warnings enabled out-of-the-box,
  - support for running tests and examples with [valgrind][] and [AddressSanitizer][],
  - support for generating code coverage from tests and examples.
- [Travis-CI][] is used for unit-testing:
  - compilers: [clang][]-3.7, [gcc][]-5.0,
  - test your code in debug/release, w/o [valgrind][], w/o [AddressSanitizer][],
  - uploads code coverage automatically to [Coveralls][].
- [Coveralls][] shows per-line code coverage.
- Automatic [Doxygen][] documentation generation and deployment to [gh-pages][].

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository and check-out your fork.
2. Add your repository to [Travis-CI][] and [Coveralls][].
3. Run `bootstrap.py` script to configure it to your needs.
   - Replace the secure token with your own and create a gh-pages branch that is empty.
4. Commit your changes to your repository (including the gh-pages branch).
5. Start working on your project.

### CMake configuration options

- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_VALGRIND`: Run the unit tests and examples under [valgrind][] if it is found.
- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_ASAN`: Run the unit tests and examples using [AddressSanitizer][].
- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_COVERAGE`: Run the unit tests and examples with code coverage instrumentation.
- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_WERROR`: Fail and stop if a warning is triggered.
- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_DEBUG_INFORMATION`: Includes debug information in the binaries.
- `PROJECT_NAME_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`: Enables assertions.

### CMake targets

- `make`: Compiles top-level targets.
- `make tests`: Compiles the tests.
- `make examples`: Compiles the examples.
- `make check`: Runs the test and the examples.
- `make doc`: Generates the documentation.

## Directory structure

The directory structure is as follows:

```text
benchmark/            : Benchmarks (reserved for future usage)
cmake/                : CMake files
include/project_name/ : Project header files
site/                 : website (reserved for future usage)
src/                  : Source files (reserved for future usage)
test/                 : Unit-tests 
.clang-format         : clang-format configuration
.travis.yml           : Travis-CI configuration
.gitignore            : With C++ defaults
CMakeLists.txt        : CMake configuration
```

## What remains to be done

- Targets to check the format and reformat your code automatically.
- Semantic versioning.
- Provide FindLib.cmake files for common libraries that automatically.
